Results of SessionInfo after running oamono notebook
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```


Notes:
- using library with versions::install.date() of 3/5/2021 for the  above packages should work.

- renv() would be preferred in future -- but appears to currently have conflicts with conda and rstudio. With renv active, python imports of installed libs fail / rstudio crashes on restart.
