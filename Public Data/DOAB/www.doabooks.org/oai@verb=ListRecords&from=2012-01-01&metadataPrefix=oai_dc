    <dc:description>&apos;Jihad&apos; is a highly charged word. Often mistranslated as &apos;Holy War&apos;, it has become synonymous with terrorism. Current political events have entirely failed to take account of the subtlety and complexity of jihad. Like many concepts with a long history, different cultural ideas have influenced the religious aspects of jihad. As a result its original meaning has been adapted, modified and destabilized - never more than at the present time. How does jihad manifest itself in Muslims&apos; everyday lives? What impact has 9/11 and its backlash had on jihad? By observing the current crisis of identity among ordinary Muslims, this timely book explores why, and in what circumstances Muslims speak of jihad. In the end, jihad is what Muslims say it is. Marranci offers us a nuanced and sophisticated anthropological understanding of Muslims&apos; lives far beyond the predictable cliches.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Have a look at the authorÂ´s blog &lt;a href=&quot;http://marranci.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;Explores the different cultural ideas that have influenced the religious&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; aspects of jihad. &apos;jihad&apos;, a term often mistranslated as &apos;Holy War&apos;, &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;has become synonymous with terrorism.

    <dc:description>A voice on late night radio tells you that a fast food joint injects its food with drugs that make men impotent. A colleague asks if you think the FBI was in on 9/11. An alien abductee on the Internet claims extra-terrestrials have planted a microchip in her left buttock. &apos;Julia Roberts in Porn Scandal&apos; shouts the front page of a gossip mag. A spiritual healer claims he can cure chronic fatigue syndrome with the energizing power of crystals . . . What do you believe? Knowledge Goes Pop examines the popular knowledges that saturate our everyday experience. We make this information and then it shapes the way we see the world. How valid is it when compared to official knowledge and why does such (mis)information cause so much institutional anxiety? Knowledge Goes Pop examines the range of knowledge, from conspiracy theory to plain gossip, and its role and impact in our culture.What do you believe?

    <dc:description>&apos;The Bushman&apos; is a perennial but changing image. The transformation of that image is important. It symbolizes the perception of Bushman or San society, of the ideas and values of ethnographers who have worked with Bushman peoples, and those of other anthropologists who use this work. Anthropology and the Bushman covers early travellers and settlers, classic nineteenth and twentieth-century ethnographers, North American and Japanese ecological traditions, the approaches of African ethnographers, and recent work on advocacy and social development. It reveals the impact of Bushman studies on anthropology and on the public. The book highlights how Bushman or San ethnography has contributed to anthropological controversy, for example in the debates on the degree of incorporation of San society within the wider political economy, and on the validity of the case for &apos;indigenous rights&apos; as a special kind of human rights. Examining the changing image of the Bushman, Barnard provides a new contribution to an established anthropology debate.&apos;The Bushman&apos; is a perennial but changing image.

    <dc:description>At the heart of Stripping, Sex, and Popular Culture lies a very personal story, of author Catherine Roach&apos;s response to the decision of her life-long best friend to become an exotic dancer. Catherine and Marie grew up together in Canada and moved to the USA to enroll in PhD programs at prestigious universities. For various reasons, Marie left her program and instead chose to work as a stripper. The author, at first troubled and yet fascinated by her friend&apos;s decision, follows Marie&apos;s journey into the world of stripping as an observer and analyst. She finds that this world raises complex questions about gender, sexuality, fantasy, feminism, and even spirituality. Moving from first hand interviews with dancers and others, the book broadens into a provocative and accessible examination of the current popularity of &quot;striptease culture,&quot; with sex-saturated media imagery, thongs gone mainstream, and stripper aerobics at your local gym. Stripping, Sex, and Popular Culture scrutinizes the naked truth of a lucrative industry whose norms are increasingly at the center of contemporary society.Moving from first hand interviews with dancers and others, this book &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;broadens into an accessible examination of the popularity of &quot;striptease&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; culture,&quot; with sex-saturated media imagery, and stripper aerobics at &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;your local gym.

    <dc:description>Written by a powerful international team of theorists, this book offers a sophisticated analysis of the central political concepts in the light of recent debates in political theory. All political argument employs political concepts. They provide the building blocks needed to construct a case for or against a given political position. To address such issues as whether or not development aid is too low, income tax too high, or how to cope with poverty and the distribution of wealth, citizens must develop views on what individuals are entitled to, what they owe to others, and the role of individual choice and responsibility in these areas. These matters turn on an understanding of concepts such as rights, equality and liberty and the ways they relate to each other. People of different political persuasions interpret such key political concepts in different ways. This book introduces students to some of the main interpretations, pointing out their strengths and weaknesses. It covers a broad range of the main concepts employed in contemporary political and theoretical debates. Separate chapters look at liberty, rights, social justice, political obligation, nationalism, punishment, social exclusion, legitimacy, the rule of law, multiculturalism, gender, public and private, democracy, environmentalism, international justice and just war. This book is perfect for students of political theory and political ideology, and indeed anyone approaching political theory for the first time.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Laura Chrisman&apos;s Colonial Discourse and Postcolonial Theory: A Reader was published in 1993. It quickly became a landmark of postcolonial studies. This timely new book offers insights into the field she helped establish. Both polemical and scholarly, Postcolonial contraventions is challenging in its analysis of black Atlantic studies, colonial discourse analysis and postcolonial theory. She provides important new paradigms for understanding imperial literature, Englishness, and black transnationalism. Her concerns range from the metropolitan centre of Conrad&apos;s Heart of Darkness, to fatherhood in Du Bois&apos;s The Souls of Black Folk; from the marketing of South African literature to cosmopolitanism in Chinua Achebe; from utopian discourse in Benita Parry to Frederic Jameson&apos;s theorisation of empire. Chrisman also critically engages with postcolonial intellectuals Paul Gilroy, David Lloyd, Anne McClintock, Edward Said, Gayatri Spivak and Robert Young, uncovering conservatism from unexpected quarters. The book joins a growing chorus of materialist voices within postcolonial studies, and addresses an urgent need for greater attention to the political, historical and socio-economic elements of cultural production. This book will be of interest to students, researchers and teachers of postcolonial studies, theory and literature; black diaspora and Atlantic studies; imperialism and Victorian literature of empire, and British literature of the nineteenth century.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The Caucasus and the Balkan region are almost automatically associated with conflict and war. At the core of these struggles lies the quest for a new institutional relationship between territory, the state and ethnic groups. Both regions share a similar historical and institutional legacy which must be regarded as having paved the ground for a rise in ethno-nationalism. There is, as a result, wide potential for conflict in both regions. However, similar structural conditions do not always turn into violent conflicts. Rapid institutional change, as occuring in the former Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union, can lead to new institutional arrangements on smaller scales - which may in turn provide stability in inter-group relations and border management. Therefore, it is of vital importance to the study of conflict analysis to identify what conditions foster new orders, and what factors, actors and institutions are necessary to create a stable equilibrium in intra- and inter-group conflicts. This book brings together a selection of case studies and theoretical approaches aimed at identifying the institutions which prevented or fostered escalation of conflict in the Caucasus and former Yugoslavia, and, will be of great benefit to students of these topics.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Pulp fictions of medieval England: Essays in popular romance</dc:title>

    <dc:creator>McDonald, Nicola</dc:creator>
       <dc:language>English</dc:language>
    <dc:description>Middle English popular romance is the most audacious and compendious testimony to the imaginary world of the English Middle Ages. Yet, with few exceptions, it remains under read and under studied. Pulp fictions of medieval England demonstrates that popular romance merits and rewards serious critical attention and that it is crucial to our understanding of the complex and conflicted world of medieval England. Pulp fictions of medieval England comprises ten essays on individual romances that, while enormously popular in the Middle Ages, have been neglected by modern scholarship. Each essay offers, in addition to valuable introductory material, an innovative reading of a single romance that interrogates, variously, the genre&apos;s aesthetic codes, its political and cultural ideologies, and its historical consciousness. The essays are informed by a wide range of theoretical perspectives and they explore topics as divergent as the bourgeois body, anti-semitism, same-sex desire, eucharistic piety, historical memory and the Crusades, miscegenation, cannibalism, the dynastic imperative and the construction of story. Nicola McDonald&apos;s collection, and the romances it investigates, are key to our understanding of the aesthetics of medieval as well as popular narrative and to the ideologies of gender and sexuality, race, religion, political formations, social class, ethics, morality and national identity with which those narratives engage. It is essential reading for specialists of medieval English literature and for theorists of medieval and modern popular culture; its inclusion of detailed introductory material makes it equally accessible to students, both undergraduate and postgraduate, taking survey courses in medieval literature.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Christopher Morgan writes with keen critical insight on the controversial poet R. S. Thomas, considered to be one of the leading writers of the twentieth century. This is the first book to treat Thomas&apos;s entire oeuvre and will prove to be an indispensible guide and companion to the complete poems. Morgan not only recontextualises and reinterprets the poet&apos;s major themes of self, nature, and the search for deity; he breaks new ground with a penetrating investigation of Thomas&apos;s long preoccupation with the philosophical and practical implications of science and technology. The book is divided into three parts, each of which interprets the development of a major theme over Thomas&apos;s twenty-seven volumes, probing these particular themes and particular poems, with a meticulous insight. The book also treats Thomas&apos;s work as a complex and interrelated whole, as a body of work that comprises a single artistic achievement, and assesses that achievement within the context of an array of major literary figures from Montaigne to Seamus Heaney and Wallace Stevens. &apos;R. S. Thomas: Identity, environment, deity&apos; proves invaluable as a beginner&apos;s introduction to the Welsh poet, as a student&apos;s guide to critical thinking about the poet&apos;s work, and as a provocative new step in scholarly studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The end of the Cold War brought about fundamental shifts in the international political system, which many scholars believe have had ripple effects in the field of national security. Literature on security during the Cold War era was primarily focused on the military, the state system, and superpower rivalry. However, with the end of the Cold War, the theory and practice of security has been subject to widespread rethinking, taking into consideration a larger variety of issues that were previously neglected. A major dilemma is that this shifting attitude has been slow to reach the Middle east, one of the most volatile, yet strategic, regions of the Cold-War era. Nowhere is the need to redefine security more pressing than in the Middle east. This book attempts to fill that gap. The contributors to the volume come from a wide variety of backgrounds, but have a common interest in dialogue in support of peace in the Middle east and aim to put forward new concepts, new policies and new discourses about security. There is no singular alternative or magical approach put forward, but a broader terrain is propounded for discussion, debate and analysis of the possibilities and constraints for conflict and conflict resolution in the region. This book will be of vital use to students of the Middle east peace process, as well as students of conflict analysis and peace studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book explores the life, thought and political commitments of the free-thinker John Toland (1670-1722). Studying both his private archive and published works, it illustrates how Toland moved in both subversive and elite political circles in England and abroad. It explores the connections between his republican political thought and his irreligious belief about Christian doctrine, the ecclesiastical establishment and divine revelation, arguing that far from being a marginal and insignificant figure, Toland counted queens, princes and government ministers as his friends and political associates. In particular his intimate relationship with the Electress Sophia of Hanover saw him act as a court philosopher, but also as a powerful publicist for the Hanoverian succession. The book argues that Toland shaped the republican tradition after the Glorious Revolution into a practical and politically viable programme, focused not on destroying the monarchy, but on reforming public religion and the Church of England. The book also examines how Toland used his social intimacy with a wide circle of men and women (ranging from Prince Eugene of Savoy to Robert Harley) to distribute his ideas in private. It explores the connections between Toland&apos;s erudition and print culture, arguing that his intellectual project was aimed at compromising the authority of Christian &apos;knowledge&apos; as much as the political power of the Church. Overall the book illustrates how Toland&apos;s ideas and influence impacted upon English political life between the 1690s and the 1720s. It forms an excellent study on a fascinating character in early modern history, scholars and enthusiasts of the period will find it extremely valuable.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book reviews a variety of approaches to the study of the European Union&apos;s foreign policy. Much analysis of EU foreign policy contains implicit theoretical assumptions about the nature of the EU and its member states, their inter-relationships, the international system in which they operate and the nature and direction of European integration. In many instances such assumptions - not being discussed openly - limit, rather than facilitate debate. The purpose of this book is to open up this field of enquiry so that students, observers and analysts of EU foreign policy can review a broad range of tools and theoretical templates from which the development and the trajectory of the EU&apos;s foreign policy can be studied. Situated as it is at the interface between European Studies and International Relations, the book also seeks to engage the attention of readers who are anxious to understand how the European Union relates to the rest of the world and to explain the efforts of the EU and its member states towards the creation of a credible, effective and principled foreign, security and defence policy.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The award-winning novelist Rohinton Mistry is recognised as one of the most important contemporary writers of postcolonial literature. His subtle yet powerful narratives engross general readers, excite critical acclaim and form staple elements of literature courses across the world. This study - the first of its kind on this writer - will provide scholars and students with an insight into the key features of Mistry&apos;s work. Peter Morey suggests how the author&apos;s writing can be read in terms of recent Indian political history, his native Zoroastrian culture and ethos, and the experience of migration which now sees him living in Canada. The texts are viewed through the lens of diaspora and minority discourse theories to show how Mistry&apos;s writing is illustrative of marginal positions in relation to sanctioned national identities. In addition, Mistry utilises and blends the conventions of oral storytelling common to the Persian and South Asian traditions with nods in the direction of the canonical figures of modern European literature, sometimes reworking and reinflecting their registers and preoccupations to create a distinctive voice redolent of the hybrid inheritance of Parsi culture and of the postcolonial predicament more generally.</dc:description>

       <dc:language>English</dc:language>
    <dc:description>This study is about the central place of the emotional world in Beckett&apos;s writing. Stating that Beckett is &apos;primarily about love&apos;, Dr. Keller makes a radical re-assessment of his influence and immense popularity. The book examines numerous Beckettian texts, arguing that they embody a struggle to remain in contact with a primal sense of internal goodness, one founded on early experience with the mother. Writing itself becomes an internal dialogue, in which the reader is engaged, between a &apos;narrative-self&apos; and a mother. Keller suggests that this is Beckett&apos;s greatest accomplishment as an artist: to document a universal struggle that allows for the birth of the mind, and to connect this struggle to the origin, and possibility of the creative act. This study integrates highly readable discussions of psychoanalytic theory, as well as clinical examples. It will be of value to scholars and readers of Beckett, and anyone interested in his place in literature and culture.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The commercialisation of sport in Europe raises important questions concerning the most appropriate method of regulating sporting activity. The development of the European Union and the internationalisation of sporting competition has added an international dimension to this debate. Yet sport is not simply a business to be regulated in the same way as any other industry. It is also a social and cultural activity. Can regulation at EU level reconcile this tension? Adopting a distinctive legal and political analysis, this book argues that the EU is receptive to the sports sectors claims for special treatment before the law. The book investigates the birth of EU sports law and policy by examining: the Bosman ruling and other significant European Court of Justice decisions; the relationship between sport and EU competition law; the possibility of sport being exempt from EU law; the relationship between sport and the EU Treaty; the development of a EU sports policy. This book is essential for those interested in the major issues facing sport and its relationship with the EU. It is essential for those interested in sports law, the politics of sport and EU integration. It offers important insights into these debates and raises key questions concerning the appropriate theoretical tools for analysing European integration.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Sweden is seen as a forerunner in environmental and ecological policy. Sweden and ecological governance is about policies and strategies for ecologically rational governance, and uses the Swedish case study to ask whether or not it is possible to move from a traditional environmental policy to a broad, integrated pursuit of sustainable development, as illustrated through the &apos;Sustainable Sweden&apos; programme. The study begins by looking at the spatial dimensions of ecological governance, and goes on to consider the integration and effectiveness of sustainable development policies. It analyses the tension between democracy and sustainable development, which has a broader relevance beyond the Swedish model, to other nation states as well as the European Union as a whole. In this book the author offers the latest word in advanced implementation of sustainable development by a front-runner in environmental and ecological policy. It will be useful for students of environmental politics and sustainable development researchers.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 shook the foundations of the global economy. What began as a localised currency crisis soon engulfed the entire Asian region. What went wrong and how did the Asian economies, long considered &apos;miracles&apos;, respond? How did the United States, Japan and other G-7 countries react to the crisis? What role did the IMF play? Why did China, which suffers from many of the same structural problems responsible for the crisis, remain conspicuously insulated from the turmoil raging in its midst? What explains Asia&apos;s remarkable recovery just three years after the crisis? In what fundamental ways did the Asian crisis serve as a catalyst to the current thinking about the &apos;new international financial architecture&apos;? What lessons can be learnt from the crisis by other emerging economies? This book provides answers to all the above questions and more. It gives a comprehensive account of how the international economic order operates, examines its strengths and weaknesses, and what needs to be done to fix it. The book will be vital to students of economics, international political economy, Asian and development studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Ireland appears to be in the throes of a remarkable process of social change. Over the last decade, the apparently inescapable status of the twenty-six counties as an economic casualty has been dramatically reversed. In recent years, it has become commonplace for the Irish Republic to register formal rates of economic growth that are the envy of every other western European state. The purpose of this exciting new book is to systematically scrutinise the interpretations and prescriptions that inform the deceptively simple metaphor of the &apos;Celtic Tiger&apos;. The standpoint of the book is that a more critical approach to the course of development being followed by the Republic is urgently required. The essays collected here set out to expose the fallacies that drive the fashionable rhetoris of Tigerhood. Four of these fallacies - that Ireland has cast off the chains of economic dependency, that everyone is benefiting from the economic recovery, that personal freedom and liberty are at an unprecedented level for all citizens, and that Ireland is also experiencing a period of strong cultural renaissance - are vigorously challenged. An esteemed list of contributors deal with issues such as immigration, women&apos;s issues, globalisation, and changing economic and social conditions. This book will be essential reading for all students of modern Ireland.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The Enlightenment and religion: The myths of modernity offers a critical survey of religious change and its causes in eighteenth-century Europe, and constitutes a radical challenge to the accepted views in traditional Enlightenment studies. Focusing on Enlightenment Italy, France and England, it illustrates how the canonical view of eighteenth-century religious change has in reality been constructed upon scant evidence and assumption, in particular the idea that the thought of the enlightened led to modernity. For despite a lack of evidence, one of the fundamental assumptions of Enlightenment studies has been the assertion that there was a vibrant deist movement that formed the &apos;intellectual solvent&apos; of the eighteenth century. The central claim of this book is that the immense ideological appeal of the traditional birth-of-modernity myth has meant that the actual lack of deists has been glossed over, and a quite misleading historical view has become entrenched. As a consequence more traditional forces for religious change have been given little or no attention. The book also raises hitherto neglected but fundamental methodological issues relating to the study of the eighteenth century and the ability of &apos;interested&apos; contemporaries to mislead posterity. Given the current pervasive topicality of notions of modernity and postmodernity in academia, this book advances a very important discussion indeed, and will be essential reading for all students studying the period.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>It is widely assumed that the French in the British Isles during the Second World War were fully-fledged supporters of General de Gaulle, and that across the channel at least, the French were a &apos;nation of resisters&apos;. This highly provocative study reveals that most exiles were on British soil by chance rather than by design, and many were not sure whether to stay. Overlooked by historians, who have concentrated on the &apos;Free French&apos; of de Gaulle, these were the &apos;Forgotten French&apos;: refugees swept off the beaches of Dunkirk; servicemen held in camps after the Franco-German armistice; Vichy consular officials left to cater for their compatriots; and a sizeable colonist community based mainly in London. Drawing on little-known archival sources, this study examines the hopes and fears of these communities who were bitterly divided among themselves, some being attracted to PÃ©tain as much as to de Gaulle. It also looks at how they fitted into British life and how the British in turn responded. The author finds that while the public was often charitable, the Government was suspicious of their loyalties and even considered general internment. Illustrated throughout, this is essential reading for anyone interested in the British and French experiences of the Second World War.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>The formation of Croatian national identity: A centuries-old dream?</dc:title>

    <dc:description>This volume assesses the formation of Croatian national identity in the 1990s. It develops a novel framework calling into question both primordial and modernist approaches to nationalism and national identity before applying that framework to Croatia. In doing so it provides a new way of thinking about how national identity is formed and why it is so important. An explanation is given of how Croatian national identity was formed in the abstract, via a historical narrative that traces centuries of yearning for a national state. The book shows how the government, opposition parties, dissident intellectuals and diaspora groups offered alternative accounts of this narrative in order to legitimise contemporary political programmes based on different visions of national identity. It then looks at how these debates were manifested in social activities as diverse as football and religion, economics and language. This volume marks an important contribution to both the way we study nationalism and national identity, and our understanding of post-Yugoslav politics and society.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book provides a complete overview of political parties in France. The social and ideological profiles of all the major parties are analysed chapter by chapter, highlighting their principal functions and dynamics within the system. This examination is complemented by analyses of bloc and system features, including the pluralist left, Europe, and the ideological space in which the parties operate. In particular, the book addresses the impressive capacity of French parties and their leaders to adapt themselves to the changing concerns of their electorates and to a shifting institutional context. Contrary to the apparently fragmentary system and increasingly hostile clashes between political personalities, the continuities in the French political system seem destined to persist. Drawing on the expertise of its French and British contributors, &apos;The French party system&apos; forms a benchmark study of the state of party politics in France. It will be an essential text for all students of French politics and parties, and for students of European politics more generally.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Though the extreme right was not particularly successful in the 1999 European elections, it continues to be a major factor in the politics of Western Europe. This book, newly available in paperback, provides a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the extreme right in the Netherlands (Centrumdemocraten, Centrumpartij&apos;86), Belgium (Vlaams Blok) and Germany (Die Republikaner, Deutsche Volksunion). On the basis of original research - using party literature - the author concludes that though individual parties might stress different issues, the extreme right party family does share a core ideology of nationalism, xenophobia, welfare chauvinism, and law and order. The author&apos;s research and conclusions clearly have broader implications for the study of the extreme right phenomenon and party ideology in general, and the book should be of interest to anyone studying or researching in the areas of European politics, political ideologies, political parties, extremism, racism or nationalism.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The international politics of the Middle East fills a major gap in the field of middle eastern political studies by combining international relations theory with concrete case studies. It will be of immense benefit to students of middle eastern politics, international relations and comparative politics. The book begins with an overview of the rules and features of the middle east regional system - the arena in which the local states, including Egypt, Turkey, Israrel and Arab states od Syria, Jordan and Iraq, operate. It goes on to analyse foreign policy-making in key states, illustrating how systematic determinants contrain this policy-making, and how these contraints are dealt with in distinctive ways depending on particular domsetic features of the individual states. Finally, the book goes on to look at the outcomes of state policies by examining several major conflicts including the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Gulf War, and the system of regional alignment. The book assesses the impact of international pentrartion in the region, including the hsitorica reasons behind the formation of the regional state system. It also analyses the continued role of the external great powers, such as the United States and the former Soviet Union and explains the process by which the region has besome incorporated into the global capitalist market.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book looks at the theoretical issue of how a democracy can defend itself from those wishing to subvert or destroy it without being required to take measures that would impinge upon the basic principles of the democratic idea, such as human rights, freedom of speech and the freedom to form political organisations. This dilemma has captured the attention of philosophers as well as legal scholars for many years, but has thus far been rarely studied employing institutional and social frameworks. In this book such frameworks are incorporated into the discussion of the &apos;paradox&apos; in an attempt to provide an answer to the question: is there a golden path which can reconcile between the democratic polity&apos;s need to defend itself and, at the same time, maintain responsibility to protect and safeguard the basic right of its citizens? It takes as its case study of this issue the Israeli response to Jewish extremism and violence, which tests the theoretical framework outlined in the first chapter of the book. Providing an extensive diachronic scrutiny of the State&apos;s response to extremist political parties, violent organisations and the infrastructure of extremism and intolerance within Israeli society. It emphasises the dynamics of the response and the factors which encourage or discourage the shift from less democratic and more democratic models of response. The book is unique in that it links social and institutional perspectives to the study. The book will be vital reading for students of peace studies, conflict analysis, international relations and international politics, as well as students of the political situation in the Middle east.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book looks at the legacy of the 1998-99 Kosovo crisis for European security affairs. It examines the debates about the nature and justification of intervention in the affairs of sovereign states. It also considers the impact of the crisis on NATO and on relations between western states and Russia both during and since Kosovo. Well-known &apos;facts&apos; are critically assessed and challenged. The authors argue, for example, that the NATO attacks on Serbia were not a &apos;war&apos;, nor did the crisis directly lead to moves to endow the European Union with its own military dimension. The authors also look at key issues and debates that have, so far, often been neglected. They consider the difficulties of entrenching &apos;western&apos; norms and values in areas where ethnic conceptions of national identity are dominant. They also place the Kosovo crisis in the context of the long-term evolution of a transatlantic &apos;community of values&apos; between Europe and North America.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book is the first in the new series The Labour governments, 1964-70 and concentrates on Britain&apos;s domestic policy during Harold Wilson&apos;s tenure as Prime Minister. The book deals, in particular, with how the Labour government and Labour party as a whole tried to come to terms with the 1960s &apos;cultural revolution&apos;. It is grounded in original research, takes unique account of responses from Labour&apos;s grass roots and from Wilson&apos;s ministerial colleagues, and constructs a &apos;total history&apos; of the party at this critical moment in history. Steven Fielding situates Labour in its wider cultural context and focuses on how the party approached issues such as the apparent transformation of the class structure, the changing place of women, rising black immigration, the apparently widening generation gap and increasing calls for direct participation in politics. The book will be of interest to all those concerned with the development of contemporary British politics and society as well as those researching the 1960s. Together with the other books in the series, on international policy and economic policy, it provides an unrivalled insight into the development of Britain under Harold Wilson&apos;s government.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This is the first book in a two-volume set that looks at the foreign policy of the Labour Party throughout the 20th century, and into the early years of the new millennium. These books rectify the dearth of literature on both the political ideology and history of Labour&apos;s foreign policy. Through an in-depth political history of Labour&apos;s foreign policy in the first half of the twentieth century this first volume produces a new theorisation of the nature of the party&apos;s foreign policy. It demonstrates that from its inception, the Labour Party has been deeply involved in and interested in international affairs. The book also shows clearly that Labour has provided an important contribution to the development of foreign policy in Britain. The first volume outlines and assesses the early development and evolution of Labour&apos;s world-view. It deals with the foreign policy of the Labour Party during a very tumultuous period on the international stage, including the First World War, the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War, the build up to and violent reality of the Second World War, and the start of the Cold War. This highly readable book provides an excellent analysis of Labour&apos;s foreign policy during this period, in which Labour experienced power for the first time. It will be of vital use to scholars and students of British political history in the twentieth century, international relations and British foreign policy.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>What was witchcraft? Were witches real? How should witches be identified? How should they be judged? Towards the end of the middle ages these were serious and important questions - and completely new. Between 1430 and 1500, a number of learned &apos;witch-theorists&apos; attempted to provide the answers to such questions, and of these perhaps the most famous are the Dominican inquisitors Heinrich Institoris and Jacob Sprenger, the authors of the Malleus Maleficarum, or The Hammer of Witches. The Malleus is widely recognised as an important medieval text and is frequently quoted by authors across a wide range of scholarly disciplines. Yet as a source the Malleus presents serious difficulties: it is difficult to understand out of context, and cannot be said to be representative of late medieval learned thinking in general. This, the first book-length study of the original text in English, provides students and scholars with an introduction to this controversial work and to the conceptual world of its authors. Like all witch-theorists, Institoris and Sprenger constructed their witch out of a constellation of pre-existing popular beliefs and learned traditions. Therefore, to understand the Malleus, one must also understand the contemporary and subsequent debates over the reality and nature of witches. Ultimately, this book argues that although the Malleus was a highly idiosyncratic text, with a view of witches very different from that of competing authors, its arguments were powerfully compelling and therefore remained influential long after alternatives were forgotten. Consequently, although focused on a single text, this study has important implications for fifteenth-century witchcraft theory. This is a fascinating work on the Malleus and will be essential to students and academics of late medieval and early modern history, religion and witchcraft studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The rise of literary theory spawned the rise of anti-aestheticism, so that even for cultural theorists, discussions concerning aesthetics were often carried out in a critical shorthand that failed to engage with the particularity of the work of art, much less the specificities of aesthetic experience. This book introduces the notion of a new aestheticism - &apos;new&apos; insofar as it identifies a turn taken by a number of important contemporary thinkers towards the idea that focussing on the specifically aesthetic impact of a work of art or literature has the potential to open radically different ways of thinking about identity, politics and culture. The appearance of a new aestheticism at a moment that is often termed &apos;post-theoretical&apos; is a direct index of the extent to which, as &apos;theory&apos; now enters a more reflective phase, there is an increased willingness among critics and philosophers to consider the ways in which literary and cultural theory often overlooked key aspects of its reliance on philosophical aesthetics. With its impressive array of contributors, The new aestheticism will be of particular interest to students and scholars of literature, philosophy and cultural studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This is a detailed study of the various ways in which London and India were imaginatively constructed by British observers during the nineteenth century. This process took place within a unified field of knowledge that brought together travel and evangelical accounts to exert a formative influence on the creation of London and India for the domestic reading public. Their distinct narratives, rhetoric and chronologies forged homologies between representations of the metropolitan poor and colonial subjects - those constituencies that were seen as the most threatening to imperial progress. Thus the poor and particular sections of the Indian population were inscribed within discourses of western civilization as regressive and inferior peoples. Over time these discourses increasingly promoted notions of overt and rigid racial hierarchies, the legacy of which remains to this day. This comparative analysis looks afresh at the writings of observers such as Henry Mayhew, Patrick Colquhoun, Charles Grant, Pierce Egan, James Forbes and Emma Roberts, thereby seeking to rethink the location of the poor and India within the nineteenth-century imagination. Drawing upon cultural and intellectual history it also attempts to extend our understanding of the relationship between &apos;centre&apos; and &apos;periphery&apos;. The other empire will be of value to students and scholars of modern imperial and urban history, cultural studies, and religious studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This exciting new book presents the first overview of Jean Jacques Rousseau&apos;s work from a political science perspective. Was Rousseau - the great theorist of the French Revolution - really a conservative? This original study argues that the author of The Social Contract was a constitutionalist much closer to Madison, Montesquieu and Locke than to revolutionaries. Outlining his profound opposition to Godless materialism and revolutionary change, this book finds parallels between Rousseau and Burke, as well as showing that Rousseau developed the first modern theory of nationalism. The book presents an integrated political analysis of Rousseau&apos;s educational, ethical, religious and political writings, and will be essential reading for students of politics, philosophy and the history of ideas.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book is an essential reference guide for students of West European politics and West European area studies. A perfect companion to European politics today (by the same authors), it contains details of major events, political leaders, important dates, organisations and recent elections, all in an accessible, easy-to-read format. A comprehensive reference work, the book also provides a sound historical background for students of contemporary Europe. It covers the information and terms of reference students need to know to understand developments in European politics from the Second World War to the present day. Much of the book is devoted to those European countries most often featured in comparative courses in colleges and universities: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain as well as the European Union. Also included are details of personalities and events which have proved decisive for smaller and less familiar European democracies. From Resistance leaders to presidents, civil wars to scandals, the forces shaping the Europe of today are detailed in this book. This book is ideal for undergraduate students on politics, European studies and area studies courses.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This fascinating study investigates the experience of English poverty between 1700 and 1900 and in the ways in which the poor made ends meet. The phrase &apos;economy of makeshifts&apos; has often been used to summarise the patchy, desperate and sometimes failing strategies of the poor for material survival. Incomes or benefits derived from such strategies allegedly ranged from wages supported by under-employment via petty crime through to charity, but allusions to this array of makeshifts usually fall short of answering vital questions about how and when the poor secured access to them. This book represents the single most significant attempt in print to supply the English &apos;economy of makeshifts&apos; with a solid, empirical basis and to advance the concept of makeshifts from a vague but convenient label to a more precise yet inclusive definition. Individual chapters written by some of the leading, young historians of welfare examine how advantages gained from access to common land, mobilisation of kinship support, resorting to crime, and other marginal resources could prop up struggling households. They suggest how the balance of these strategies might change over time or be modified by gender, life-cycle and geography. A comprehensive introduction summarises the state of research on English poverty, and a thought-provoking conclusion makes valuable suggestions for the direction of future research. This book will be crucial for historians of social life and welfare, of interest to researchers working on eighteenth- /nineteenth- century England and will be useful to undergraduates seeking guidance on the historiography of poverty.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The early modern period was of great significance throughout Europe with respect to its gradual transition from a largely oral to a fundamentally literate society. On the one hand, the spoken word remained of the utmost importance to the dissemination of ideas, the communication of information and the transmission of the cultural repertoire. On the other hand, the proliferation of written documents of all kinds, the development of printing and the spread of popular literacy combined to transform the nature of communication. Studies previous to this have traditionally focussed on individual countries or regions, and emphasised the contradictions between oral and literate culture. The essays in this fascinating collection depart from these approaches in several ways. By examining not only English, but also Scottish and Welsh oral culture, they provide the first pan-British study of the subject. The authors also emphasise the ways in which oral and literate culture continued to compliment and inform each other, rather than focusing exclusively on their incompatibility, or on the &apos;inevitable&apos; triumph of the written word. The chronological focus, ranging from the sixteenth to the mid-nineteenth century, with glances ahead to the twentieth, set the problem against a longer chronological span than most other studies, providing a link between early modern and modern oral and literate cultures. This book it will be of interest to students and scholars of British history, Linguistics, Literary Studies and Folklore Studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The Third Way is said to be the guiding philosophy for New Labour and centre-left parties and governments across the globe. Moving beyond attempts to define and defend the Third Way, this innovative collection embarks on a critical examination of this key concept. The editors draw on expert contributions from a range of disciplines and perspectives to dissect the Third Way in theory and in practice, assess its legacy and suggest alternatives. The book begins by reviewing attempts to define the Third Way. It then examines what the Third Way implies for our understanding of the economy and the state, before critically addressing the philosophical and practical implications of its attempt to use the term &apos;community&apos;. The final section deconstructs Third Way rhetoric and discourse. The conclusion reviews how these critical insights might form a basis for alternative political projects. Written in a rigorous but accessible style, this interdisciplinary collection is essential reading for anyone with an interest in understanding a key idea propounded by New Labour and the contemporary centre-left. It will appeal to anyone studying politics, sociology, contemporary history, social policy, social and political theory, and applied philosophy. It provides both an introduction to the topic and new and original insights for specialists in the area.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>&apos;The truest form of patriotism&apos;: Pacifist feminism in Britain, 1870-1902</dc:title>

    <dc:description>This fascinating book explores the pervasive influence of pacifism on Victorian feminism. Drawing on previously unused source material, it provides an account of Victorian women who campaigned for peace and the many feminists who incorporated pacifist ideas into their writing on women and women&apos;s work. It explores feminists&apos; ideas about the role of women within the empire, their eligibility for citizenship and their ability to act as moral guardians in public life. Brown shows that such ideas made use - in varying ways - of gendered understandings of the role of force and the relevance of arbitration and other pacifist strategies. &apos;The truest for of patriotism&apos; examines the work of a wide range of individuals and organisations, from well-known feminists such as Lydia Becker, Josephine Butler and Millicent Garrett Fawcett, to lesser-known figures such as the Quaker pacifists Ellen Robinson and Priscilla Peckover. Women&apos;s work within male-dominated organisations, such as the Peace Society and the International Arbitration and Peace Association, is covered alongside single-sex organisations, such as the International Council of Women. Also reviewed are the arguments put forward in feminist journals like the Englishwoman&apos;s Review and the Women&apos;s Penny Paper. Brown uncovers a wide range of pacifist, internationalist and anti-imperialist strands in Victorian feminist thought, focusing on how these ideas developed within the political and organisational context of the time. This book will be of interest to anyone studying nineteenth-century social movements, and essential reading for those with an interest in the history of British feminism.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This study explores the normative dimension of the evolving role of the United Nations in peace and security and, ultimately, in governance. What is dealt with here is both the UN&apos;s changing raison d&apos;Ãªtre and the wider normative context within which the organisation is located. The study looks at the UN through the window of one of its most contentious, yet least understood, practices: active involvement in intra-state conflicts as epitomised by UN peacekeeping. Drawing on the conceptual tools provided by the &apos;historical structural&apos; approach, this study seeks to understand how and why the international community continuously reinterprets or redefines the UN&apos;s role with regard to intra-state conflicts. The study concentrates on intra-states &apos;peacekeeping environments&apos;, and examines what changes, if any, have occurred to the normative basis of UN peacekeeping in intra-state conflicts from the early 1960s to the early 1990s. One of the original aspects of the study is its analytical framework, where the conceptualisation of &apos;normative basis&apos; revolves around objectives, functions and authority, and is closely connected with the institutionalised values in the UN Charter such as state sovereignty, human rights and socio-economic development. This book is essential reading for postgraduate students of IR and international peacekeeping organisations.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The role of the Congress is essential to any study of American government and politics. It would be impossible to gain a complete understanding of the American system of government without an appreciation of the nature and workings of this essential body. This is an introductory text aimed at undergraduates studying American politics and American society. It looks at the workings of the United States Congress, and uses the Republican period of ascendancy, which lasted from 1994 until 2000, as an example of how the Congress works in practice. The book illustrates the basic principles of Congress using contemporary and recent examples, while also drawing attention to the changes that took place in the 1990s. The period of Republican control is absent from many of the standard texts and is of considerable academic interest for a number of reasons, not least the 1994 election, the budget deadlock in 1995 and the Clinton impeachment scandal of 1999. The book traces the origin and development of the United States Congress, before looking in depth at the role of representatives and senators, the committee system, parties in Congress, and the relationship between Congress and the President, the media and interest groups. This will be the first textbook on the market that enables students to incorporate these developments into their work and into their thinking about contemporary American politics and society.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Turkey&apos;s involvement in the Gulf War in 199 paved the way for the country&apos;s acceptance into the European Union. This book traces that process and in the first part looks at Turkey&apos;s foreign policy in the 1990s, considering the ability of the country to withstand the repercussions of the fall of communism. It focuses on Turkey&apos;s achievement in halting and minimising the effects of the temporary devaluationin its strategic importance that resulted from the waning of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the skilful way in which Turkay avoided becoming embroiled in the ethnic upheavals in Central Asia, the balkans and the Middle East, and the development of a continued policy of closer integration into the European and western worlds. Internal politics are the focus of the second part of the book, addressing the curbing of the Kurdish revolt, the economic gains made, and the strengthening of civil society. Nachmani goes on to analyse the prospects for Turkey in the twenty-first century, in the light of the possible integration into Europe, which may leave the country&apos;s leadership free to deal effectively with domestic issues. This book will make crucial reading for anyone studying Turkish politics, or indeed European or European Union politics.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book looks at the important issues in British politics since 1945, including a brief guide to the changing political culture of Britain in that period. It will be essential reading for all students studying politics at A2 level, as it covers all the important issues required by the main examining boards. Neil McNaughton is a seasoned writer at this level. He begins by reviewing the changing nature of the principal political ideologies - Conservatism, Labourism and Liberalism - before discussing how these ideological changes impact generally on policy developments in the UK. Having described the changing nature of the political culture, addressing partisan dealignment, changing morality, the decline of religion and class fragmentation, he examines, on a chapter by chapter basis, the key issues of British politics today: the economy, the welfare state, law and order, race relations, the particular problems affecting Northern Ireland, devolution, constitutional reform, rights, the environment, issues of gender and sexual orientation, European integration and the European Union, the impact of the European Union on Britain, ending with a brief summary of the issues that are likely to take centre stage in British politics in the first decade of the new century. Written in an accessible style, with helpful features such as summaries, definitions, tables and boxes to illuminate the points made, this book is urgently needed as students grapple with the issues thrown up by the new examinations.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Written specifically to cover the A2 component of the GCE Government and Politics A-level, this book is a comprehensive introduction to the political ideas and movements that have shaped the modern world. Underpinned by the work of major thinkers such as Hobbes, Locke, Marx, Mill, Weber and others, the first half of the book looks at political concepts including the state and sovereignty, the nation, democracy, representation and legitimacy, freedom, equality and rights, obligation and citizenship. There is also a specific chapter which addresses the role of ideology in the shaping of politics and society. The second half of the book addresses traditional theoretical subjects such as socialism, Marxism and nationalism, before moving on to more contemporary movements such as environmentalism, ecologism and feminism. The subject is covered in a clear, accessible style, and includes a number of student-friendly features, such as chapter summaries, key points to consider, definitions and tips for further sources of information. There is a definite need for a text of this kind. It will be invaluable for students of government and politics at introductory level.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Caribbean migration to Britain brought many new things - new musics, new foods, new styles. It brought new ways of thinking too. This lively, innovative book explores the intellectual ideas which the West Indians brought with them to Britain. It shows that for more than a century West Indians living in Britain developed a dazzling intellectual critique of the codes of Imperial Britain. This is the first comprehensive discussion of the major Caribbean thinkers who came to live in twentieth-century Britain. Chapters discuss the influence of, amongst others, C. L. R. James, Una Marson, George Lamming, Jean Rhys, Claude McKay and V. S. Naipaul. The contributors to this fascinating volume draw from many different disciplines to bring alive the thought and personalities of the figures they discuss, providing a dramatic picture of intellectual developments in Britain from which we can still learn much. A lucid introduction argues that the recovery of this Caribbean past, on the home-territory of Britain itself, reveals much about the prospects of multiracial Britain. Written in an accessible manner, undergraduates and general readers interested in relations between the Caribbean and Britain, imperial history, literature, cultural and black studies will all find much of interest in this collection.</dc:description>

It innovatively brings together the interests of historians in nineteenth-century witchcraft and the twentieth-century fieldwork of anthropologists and sociologists on the continued relevance of witch beliefs. The book covers England, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Germany, France, Finland, Transylvania and Northern Ireland. It examines the experience of and attitudes towards witchcraft from both above and below. They demonstrate the widespread fear of witches amongst the masses during the nineteenth century, and the continued but more restricted relevance of witchcraft in the twentieth century. While the educated classes generally denounced witch-believers as either superstitious, foolish or both, secular and religious authorities still had to find strategies of dealing with the demands of those who believed themselves the victims of witchcraft. Moreover the rise of the folklore movement and the growth of anthropology as an academic discipline over the period provided a huge body of evidence on continuing beliefs that many had consigned to the past. This book will be essential reading for those interested in the continued importance of witchcraft and magic in the modern era. More generally it will appeal to those with a lively interest in the cultural history of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Given the widespread belief in witchcraft and the existence of laws against such practices, why did witch-trials fail to gain momentum and escalate into &apos;witch-crazes&apos; in certain parts of early modern Europe? This book answers this question by examining the rich legal records of the German city of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, a city which experienced a very restrained pattern of witch-trials and just one execution for witchcraft between 1561 and 1652. The author explores the factors that explain the absence of a &apos;witch-craze&apos; in Rothenburg, placing particular emphasis on the interaction of elite and popular priorities in the pursuit (and non-pursuit) of alleged witches at law. By making the witchcraft narratives told by the peasants and townspeople of Rothenburg central to its analysis, the book also explores the social and psychological conflicts that lay behind the making of accusations and confessions of witchcraft. Furthermore, it challenges existing explanations for the gender-bias of witch-trials, and also offers insights into other areas of early modern life, such as experiences of and beliefs about communal conflict, magic, motherhood, childhood and illness. Written in a lively narrative style, this innovative study invites a wide readership to share in the compelling drama of early modern witch trials. It will be essential reading for researchers working in witchcraft studies, as well as those in the wider field of early modern European history.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The 1990s witnessed a veritable explosion in women&apos;s writing in France, with a particularly exciting new generation of writers coming to the fore, names like Christine Angot, Marie Darrieussecq and RÃ©gine Detambel. Other authors such as Paule Constant, Sylvie Germain, Marie Redonnet and LeÃ¯la Sebbar, who had begun publishing in the 1980s, claimed their mainstream status in the 1990s with new texts. This book provides an up-to-date introduction to and analysis of new women&apos;s writing in contemporary France including both new writers of the 1990s and their more established counterparts. The editors&apos; incisive introduction situates these authors and their texts at the centre of the current trends and issues concerning French literary production today, whilst fifteen original essays focus on individual writers. The volume includes specialist bibliographies on each writer, incorporating English translations, major interviews, and key critical studies. Quotations are given in both French and English throughout. An invaluable study resource, its clear and accessible style makes this book of interest to the general reader as well as to students of all levels, to teachers of a wide range of courses on French culture, and to specialist researchers of French and Francophone literature.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Increasingly, technology is at stake in toys, games and playing. With the immense popularity of computer games, questions concerning the role and function of technology in play have become more pressing. A key aspect of the increasing technologization and digitalization of both toys and play is the vagueness of borders between producers, consumers and players. In these so-called participatory cultures, players do not simply play with toys designed behind closed doors but become co-designers. This book takes a critical look at the advantages and disadvantages of participatory cultures and places the changing world of toys, games and playing in a historical context. Contrary to many New Media and computer game studies, this book takes the historical background of these phenomena into account by situating the changing world of play in the context of the social and cultural processes of commodification, domestication and urbanization from the 1850s to the present.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book challenges every common presumption that exists about the trafficking of women for the sex trade. It is a detailed account of an entire population of trafficked Albanian women whose varied experiences, including selling sex on the streets of France, clearly demonstrate how much the present discourse about trafficked women is misplaced and inadequate. The heterogeneity of the women involved and their relationships with various men is clearly presented as is the way women actively created a panoptical surveillance of themselves as a means of self-policing. There is no artificial divide between women who were deceived and abused and those who &quot;choose&quot; sex work; in fact the book clearly shows how peripheral involvement in sex work was to the real agenda of the women involved. Most of the women described in this book were not making economic decisions to escape desperate poverty nor were they the uneducated naÃ¯ve entrapped into sexual slavery. The women&apos;s success in transiting trafficking to achieve their own goals without the assistance of any outside agency is a testimony to their resilience and resolve.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Established institutions and policies of dealing with religious diversity in liberal democratic states are increasingly under pressure. Practical politics and political theory is caught in a trap between a fully secularized state (strict separation of state and politics from completely privatized religions based on an idealized version of American denominationalism or French republicanism) and neo-corporatist or &apos;pillarized&apos; regimes of selective cooperation between states and organized religions. The book offers an original, comprehensive conceptual, theoretical and practical approach to problems of governance of religious diversity from a multi-disciplinary perspective combining moral and political philosophy, constitutional law, history, sociology and anthropology of religions and comparative institutionalism. Proposals of associative democracy - a moderately libertarian, flexible version of democratic institutional pluralism - are introduced and scrutinized whether they can serve as as plausible third way overcoming the inherent deficiencies of the predominant models in theory and practice.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The author of this innovative study argues that key politicians and their policy ideas, through &quot;ideational leadership&quot;, have played an important role in the passing of structural reforms in the change-resistant German welfare state. This argument is based on in-depth case studies of individual reforms in health care, pensions and unemployment insurance since the early 1990s as well as a concise analysis of recent changes in family policy. Stiller concludes that Germany, traditionally a Bismarckian welfare state, has embarked on a path of &apos;hybridisation&apos; that confronts German politics with growing societal divisions. This thought-provoking title is highly recommended for policymakers, scholars and students interested in the past and future reforms of the German welfare state, leadership, and the role of ideas in policymaking.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>In 1609, the first Dutch settlers arrived in America and established trading posts, small towns, and forts up and down what we now call the Hudson River. To this day, American children are taught the thrilling history of the transformation of this settlement, New Netherland, and its capital, New Amsterdam, from landmark port into present-day New York State and the island of Manhattan. But, the Dutch legacy extended far beyond New York, as Cookies, Coleslaw and Stoops reveals. From Santa Claus (after the Dutch folklore saint Sinterklaas) and his sleigh (the pronunciation of the Dutch slee is almost identical) to a dumbhead talking poppycock, the contributions of the Dutch language to American English are indelibly embedded to some of our most vernacular terms and expressions. The menu in most of our restaurants sports some originally Dutch names, and even our dollar is named after a Dutch coin (daalder). In this captivating volume, the renowned linguist Nicoline van der Sijs glosses over 300 Dutch loan words like these that travelled to the New World on board the Dutch ship the Halve Maan, captained by Henry Hudson, which dropped anchor in Manhattan more than 400 years ago. Surprisingly, the Dutch also gave several Native American languages words for everyday things like &quot;pants&quot;, &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;turkey&quot;. Lively and accessible, the information presented in this volume charts the journey of these words into the American territory and languages, from more obscure uses which maybe have survived in only regional dialects to such ubiquitous contributions to our language like Yankee, cookie, and dope. Each entry marks the original arrival of its term into American English and adds up-to-date information on its evolving meaning, etymology, and regional spread. Not to be missed by anyone with a passion for the history behind our everyday expressions, Cookies, Coleslaw and Stoops is the perfect gift for the linguistic adventurer in us all.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>In theory, republican orthodoxy does not acknowledge the political dignity of any intermediary body between free and equal individuals, stripped of all particularism, and the sovereign nation. This is why, right up to the present, the French public debate has been marked by an entrenched suspicion towards all forms of Â«communitarismÂ», and by the proscription of the very concept of multicultural politics. But have the policies actually pursued by republican France been consistent with the proclaimed principles? Is it genuinely possible to claim that cultural identities have never been publicly Â«recognisedÂ»? This multidisciplinary investigation proposes to address the ambiguous relations between theory and practice in the Republican management of cultural pluralism.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>&quot;Saggi&quot; brings together the results of the research activity carried out on the PhD course in English and American Studies (Department of Modern Philology, University of Florence). The contributions relate to the theatre, narrative, poetry, autobiographical writing and correspondence, and range from the Renaissance up to the present day. The heterogeneity of the material illustrates the free choice of the young academics who, in the climate of collaboration that was established, decided to address the technical and editorial aspects of the book as a team in the open access editorial workshop of the Department.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book offers a portrait of Leningrad in the 1960s, of its cultural life in those years permeated by a great hope for change. Leningrad, now St. Petersburg, is the heir and witness of the rise and fall of the &apos;Soviet hope&apos; for an authentic change, its evolution and its inevitable decline. Through an analysis of the poems of Iosif Brodskij, Stefania Pavan maps out the process that led the intelligencija of Leningrad to disclose their claims, to give shape to the intellectual conscience of the city, and that subsequently constrained them to adopt the opposite approach, concealing â in a semi-visible space and in the myriad modes of the &apos;samizdat&apos; â the values, names and images of the hope of change. Through an analysis of the linguistic peculiarities of The dregs , one of the &apos;classic&apos; short stories of Boris Ivanov, Simonetta Signorini proposes a micro-history of the Russian language in the 60s, to which the study carried out by Ljudmila Zubova on the poems of Viktor Sosnora makes a useful contribution. The essay by Irina Dvizova highlights an aspect of the culture of Leningrad that can be considered extremely topical, in terms both of argument and as a method of reading literary history: the relation between the city and the Dostoevskij museum.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This volume consists of a collection of essays by five German scholars from various Italian universities â R. Calabrese, R. Caruzzi, M. Fancelli, L. Perrone Capano, R. Svandrlik (editor) â and N. Å libar from the University of Lubiana, that meld formal research and musical pace and structure with the pitiless radicalism and the consistency of the issues addressed, first and foremost the oppression inherent to power relations. In the commitment to reveal the mechanisms of manipulation, from the most obvious to the most subtle, the author herself becomes a manipulator of language of exceptional creativity and daring, with the guiding thread of the gender perspective. The volume is completed by the translation of the speech made by the Austrian writer when she was awarded the Nobel prize in 2004, and by a bibliography (edited by Claudia Vitale), focused in particular on the reception in Italy and on the scarcity of Italian scientific studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Da Blake a Yeats. Sistemi simbolici e costruzioni poetiche is an investigation into the â from many aspects decisive â influence that the symbolic system and visionary poetry of the great English romantic William Blake had on the imagination of William Butler Yeats from his earliest youth. This authentic poetic and visionary apprenticeship in the work of Blake, which culminated in 1893 in the edition in three volumes accompanied by an exhaustive introduction and commentary: The Works of William Blake Poetic, Symbolic, and Critical, was decisive for the formation of the symbolic system that was to nourish all Yeats&apos; poetry. Adopting an approach to the reading that unfurls from an initial analysis of Blake&apos;s poetic corpus, and hence from the mythical-symbolic pantheon that surfaces from this, the book then traces Yeats&apos; initial particular hodos chameliontos, profoundly marked by magical and esoteric experiences, subsequently entering into the meanders of the aesthetic, philosophical and poetic interrelations between the symbolic system of William Blake and that of W. B. Yeats. Da Blake a Yeats illuminates how The Works of William Blake represents the first genuine formalisation of Blakeian and esoteric teachings within Yeats&apos; system, while also representing, for Yeats himself, a keystone in his vision of Blake and an inexhaustible spring for the evolution of his symbolic system and his imagination.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>In recent years the leader of &quot;Giustizia e LibertÃ &quot; has been the focus of a renewed and extensive attention. The author reconstructs the itinerary of Carlo Rosselli, conducting the theoretical analysis in the light of the complexity of the historic context. From the years of the Great War to the exile in France, intellectual meditation and political commitment are inextricably entwined threads in the career of the Florentine antifascist. In the attempt to pinpoint the key passages of this unquiet quest, the book traces the stages of an evolving thought. A thought that was matured through critical comparison with liberal theory and Marxist doctrine, found inspiration in English socialism and conceived opposition to the Fascist regime as the grounds for a project of progressive democracy.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>In the critical literature on Georg BÃ¼chner this monograph represents the first organic work devoted to the subject of the body â a pivotal issue for an understanding of his writings. The book investigates the significance assumed by the human body in three spheres of analysis: the political, the erotic and the scientific-philosophical. In the latter area the analysis hinges on the relations between BÃ¼chner&apos;s work and the writings of the three principal French materialist philosophers of the eighteenth century: La Mettrie, d&apos;Holbach and HelvÃ©tius. The appraisal of this relation illustrates not only BÃ¼chner&apos;s appropriation of the legacy of ideas of French materialism, but also moments in which he satirises, sarcastically criticises or outrightly rejects certain central aspects of this vision of man and nature. From this analysis and the study of the political significance of the body and the erotic aspect, it emerges that the body, understood as Leib â human body, lived and living, the hub of subjective perception and experience â not only has a crucial function in the figurative layout of the literary works, but is also the focal point of BÃ¼chner&apos;s view of man, thus assuming a central importance both in the three areas examined and in the more strictly aesthetic sphere. This book won the Premio Associazione Sigismondo Malatesta &quot;Opera Critica&quot; - Letteratura, Teatro e Arti dello spettacolo - Edizione 2009.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The advent and spread of Internet and the Web have radically transformed the modes of communication. This book considers a particular ambit of online communication, namely that of science. In the first place, the author reconstructs the circumstances that gave rise to the modern system of scientific communication, and the qualitative and quantitative tools for scientific evaluation. After this, the analysis concentrates on the history, philosophy and architecture of the Web from its inception through to the most recent developments of both a technical (Semantic Web) and a socio-cultural kind (Web 2.0). Finally an open and democratic model for scientific communication is projected and proposed, made possible through the use of transparent, accessible and distributed tools.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Tra sensi e spirito investigates the origins of a sort of &apos;Copernican revolution&apos; that took place in western culture when music acquired an undisputed primacy over the other arts, becoming the privileged medium of metaphysical knowledge, if not actually the very emblem of absolute Truth. Starting from the analysis of the principal oppositions (between melody and harmony, word and sound, voice and instruments) emerging from the aesthetic debate that developed in the latter half of the eighteenth century, first in France and later in Germany, Tra sensi e spirito brings to light the essential ambivalence of music, in which we can discern a dual nature: sensual-erotic and mystical-spiritual. Examining these two aspects, supremely exemplified in the works of Wilhelm Heinse and Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder and the characters created by them, the book brings out the figure of the &apos;problematic&apos; artist in a modern sense, who experiences with profound unease the ambiguity of the &quot;criminal innocence&quot; of the musical phenomenon: a musical phenomenon that acts at once as a redeeming and a &apos;narcotic&apos; force, engendering a loss of contact with reality.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>W. B. Yeats e la cultura italiana examines the &quot;Italianism&quot; of William Butler Yeats and the popularity of the Irish poet in Italian poetry and criticism. Appraising the presence and evocative influence of &quot;learned Italian things&quot; on the work of the Irish poet, through the study of his letters and as illustrated by the library conserved by his daughter Anne, and with constant references to the texts themselves, the Italian influences most evidently present in the work of the Irish Nobel winner are analysed and discussed. This first section of the book presents in its entirety the largely unpublished correspondence between Years and the philosopher Mario Manlio Rossi. Subsequently, observing the influence and the fascination exerted by the work of Yeats on Italian poets such as Montale, Solmi and Giudici, who even translated some of Yeats&apos; poems, and Lucio Piccolo, who also had a brief epistolary exchange with the Irish poet, this too still partially unpublished, we arrive at a critical examination of the Italian reception of Yeats&apos; works. W. B. Yeats e la cultura italiana is rounded off by an annotated bibliography of the translations and works of criticism which represents an important overview of the penetration of Yeats&apos; work in Italy (1905-2005).</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The reception and popularity of the work of Emmanuel Joseph SieyÃ¨s has gone through different and erratic phases. Nonetheless, in recent years there has been a remarkable revival of interest in the AbbÃ©&apos;s thought. This book is intended to exploit this SieyÃ¨s-renaissance, proposing a reconstruction of the constitutional doctrine of the abbot in the light of the latest interpretative acquisitions. The guiding thread of the analysis is the acknowledgement that, underlying the main political-constitutional proposals of SieyÃ¨s, we can glimpse a profoundly rationalist philosophical substructure. After presenting the nucleus of this philosophical approach, the book proceeds to shed light on the coherence linking the main constitutional structures upon which the abbot was working in the course of the early years of the Revolution. It focuses in particular on the concepts that contributed to make up the basic grammar of modern and liberal constitutionalism: representation, citizenship, constituent power, rights of man, the division of the powers and the control of constitutionality. The idea is that, by pursuing this approach, it is possible to arrive at an overall picture of the constitutional doctrine of the abbot that reflects both its systematic quality and its originality.</dc:description>

Per una analisi del tedesco tra codici e varietÃ &quot; applies the terminology and methods of various subfields addressing textual analysis in German, namely textual linguistics, semiotics, pragmatics, speech linguistics and linguistic psychology, which are brought together in this study to attempt to develop, along with the specific research, a methodology for the science of the text in its general characteristics. Some translations of the nineteenth-century humorist Wilhelm Busch, the Italian version of a key test of the Bauhaus and the transcription of the TV electoral duel of 2005 between Angela Merkel and Helmut SchrÃ¶der illustrate the broad chronological and typological spectrum of the investigation.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Go Southwest, Old Man, a sort of personal remake of &apos;Go West, Young Man&apos;, the founding episteme of the American nineteenth century, conciliates these two souls (well, not to be pretentious, let&apos;s simply say two sides) that have actually always lived in harmony. This is a book generated by a quarter of a century spent wandering around the canyons and deserts of Arizona, Colorado, Utah and, above all New Mexico, with a view to penetrating the by now universal legend of the West, approaching the cultures (English, Hispanic and native American), and mastering the literature. The slant is composite: melding the scholarly with the informative and the travel journal, and the writing is composite too, because the book speaks English and Italian. It talks about cinema (lots of John Ford) and about detective stories, the most popular genre here, about visual arts and Latino folklore, about the legend of the West, the so-called &apos;Soul of the Southwest&apos;, and the kitsch style of Santa Fe. And it talks about (and with) some of the greatest writers that the Southwest has spawned: Rudolfo Anaya, Stanley Crawford, John Nichols and Hillerman. So what we have is a first-hand experience of the Southwest; where the ego is not entrenched within a precise disciplinary role but opens up â and exposes itself â to the thrilling risk of the discovery that can renew it.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book focuses upon an aspect which has been little investigated to date in the poetics of Iosif Brodskij: the rich intertextual network that links his verses to classical literature. Brodskij&apos;s intertext never appears as imitation but rather as mimesis, like an inescapable mediation - at times concealed by the presence of cultures diachronically closer, the Russian in the first place - strongly impregnated with meaning and teaching: &quot;(As for creation, the pen has created very little). / But how much light it casts in the night, / the ink, merging with the darkness!&quot;. This book proposes moments of reflection on the intense and nuanced relation that connects Brodskij&apos;s poetics with the poetics of Aristotle, and the subtle but equally strong links of Brodskij&apos;s idea of democracy with that of the organisation of government in Plato&apos;s Republic. Pursuing an historic approach, the book delineates the characteristics of Brodskij as a reader of the classics and, at the same time, as a person intimately involved, at an individual and collective level, in the events of Russian culture. In Brodskij&apos;s dialogical approach, in particular in relation to ancient classical culture, the lineaments of the poet emerge clearly. Considered in their globality, these reveal inspiration, thought (profound, and strongly impregnated with philosophy), moral rigour (ironic and self-ironising), the renunciation of the display of feelings, and the tension towards an autobiographical writing that is universalised and externalised, a strong and constant link with the narration of myths and, in a manner that is increasingly marked over the time of his life and work, a progressive prevalence of the signs of the classical authors.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This is the second volume of a history of the University of Manchester since 1951. It spans seventeen critical years in which public funding was contracting, student grants were diminishing, instructions from the government and the University Grants Commission were multiplying, and universities feared for their reputation in the public eye. It provides a frank account of the University&apos;s struggle against these difficulties and its efforts to prove the value of university education to society and the economy. This volume describes and analyses not only academic developments and changes in the structure and finances of the University, but the opinions and social and political lives of the staff and their students as well. It also examines the controversies of the 1970s and 1980s over such issues as feminism, free speech, ethical investment, academic freedom and the quest for efficient management. The author draws on official records, staff and student newspapers, and personal interviews with people who experienced the University in very different ways. With its wide range of academic interests and large student population, the University of Manchester was the biggest unitary university in the country, and its history illustrates the problems faced by almost all British universities. The books will appeal to past and present staff of the University and its alumni, and to anyone interested in the debates surrounding higher education in the late twentieth century. A history of the University of Manchester, 1951-73 by Brian Pullan is also available from Manchester University Press.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Drawing upon an extensive range of archival and secondary sources from both sides of the Atlantic, this pioneering book provides the first full-length study of the controversial personal relationship between Prime Minister Harold Wilson and President Lyndon B. Johnson, often drawing on material that has only recently been opened to the public. Whilst Wilson was a firm supporter of the idea of a &apos;special relationship&apos; between Britain and the United States and wanted to use his dealings with the White House to strengthen his credentials as a world statesman, Johnson held the British leader in low esteem and disdained the idea of a &apos;special&apos; Anglo-American relationship. Difficulties stemming from the Vietnam War, British economic weakness and the UK&apos;s abrogation of its world power status exacerbated the strain between Wilson and Johnson, leading to what was probably the most fractious and troubled of all the relationships between British prime ministers and American presidents. The work also explores the more general nature of Anglo-American bonds in this period, arguing that the impact of the substantive issues, along with the limitations of the relationship between Wilson and Johnson, led to a serious weakening of the high-level ties between Britain and the United States. This book will be of vital interest to students of British and US foreign policy, of Anglo-American relations, and summit diplomacy, as well as to those with an interest in Harold Wilson and Lyndon Johnson themselves.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book draws together for the very first time examples of the &apos;aesthetic pacifism&apos; practised during the Great War by such celebrated individuals as Virginia Woolf, Siegfried Sassoon and Bertrand Russell. In addition, the book outlines the stories of those less well-known who shared the mind-set of the Bloomsbury Group when it came to facing the first &apos;total war&apos;. The research for this study took five years, gathering evidence from all the major archives in Great Britain and abroad. This is the first time that such wide-ranging evidence has been placed together in order to paint a complete picture of this fascinating form of anti-war expression. Beginning with an introduction to the period and issues involved, the narrative commences with Bertrand Russell and Cambridge before moving on to cover the disparate responses of Bloomsbury, the reactions of other celebrated writers and artists before covering the more obscure participants. A themed conclusion draws the material to a close. With the Great War and the Bloomsbury Group continuing to exert a strong grip on the popular imagination, this detailed book is written with the general reader very much in mind, as well as the specialist.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Across the margins offers a comparative, theoretically informed analysis of the cultural formation of the Atlantic Archipelago. In its overall conception and in specific contributions (including an introductory essay), this collection demonstrates the benefits of working across the disciplines of history, geography, literature and cultural studies, but also presents new configurations of cultural forms hitherto associated with specifically national and sub-national literatures. The essays, from both established and new scholars working in the fields of British, Irish and comparative cultural studies, addresses broad questions raised by the interface between language, gender, sexuality and ethnicity in relation to marginal identities, but also includes specific genre-based case studies on contemporary poetry, fiction, drama, popular music and art. This format recognises the importance of specific concerns which emerge from different geographical locations, but also encourages movement beyond traditional formations of national cultures. Responding to recent constitutional developments in Great Britain and Ireland, it explores their implications both for the cultural negotiations of marginality and for established critical paradigms. It is therefore of interest to undergraduates, postgraduates and academics working in the areas of comparative literature, postcolonial theory, Irish, Scottish and Welsh studies, and British political/cultural studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This new, completely revised and re-written edition of aesthetics and subjectivity brings up to date the original book&apos;s account of the path of German philosophy from Kant, via Fichte and Holderlin, the early Romantis, Schelling, Hegel, Schleimacher, to Nietzsche, in view of recent historical research and contemporary arguments in philosophy and theory in the humanities. The original book helped make subjectivity, aesthetics, music and language a significant part of debate in the humanity. Bowie develops the approaches to these areas in relation to new theoretical advances which bridge the divide between the continental and analytical traditions of philosophy. In light of the huge growth of interest in German philosophy as a resource for re-thinking both literary and cultural theory, and contemporary philosophy, aesthetics and subjectivity will be indispensable reading for students and teachers in all humanities subjects, from literature, to philosophy, to music and beyond.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Social democracy has made a political comeback in recent years, especially under the influence of the Third Way. Not everyone is convinced, however, that Third Way social democracy is the best means of reviving the Left&apos;s project. This book considers this dissent and offers an alternative approach. Bringing together a range of social and political theories, After the new social democracy engages with some of the most important contemporary debates regarding the present direction and future of the Left. Drawing upon egalitarian, feminist and environmental ideas it proposes that the social-democratic tradition can be renewed but only if the dominance of conservative ideas is challenged more effectively. It explores a number of issues with this aim in mind, including justice, the state, democracy, new technologies, future generations and the advances in genetics. Lively and authoritative, After the new social democracy offers a distinctive contribution to political ideas. It will appeal to all of those interested in politics, philosophy, social policy and social studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Balkan Holocausts?: Serbian and Croatian victim centred propaganda and the war in Yugoslavia</dc:title>

    <dc:description>Balkan Holocausts compares and contrasts Serbian and Croatian propaganda from 1986 to 1999, analysing each group&apos;s contemporary interpretations of history and current events. It offers a detailed discussion of holocaust imagery and the history of victim-centred writing in nationalism theory, including the links between the comparative genocide debate, the so-called holocaust industry and Serbian and Croatian nationalism. No studies on Yugoslavia have thus far devoted significant space to such analysis. Offering a detailed analysis of Serbian and Croatian propaganda over the internet, the book discusses how and why the internet war was as important as the ground wars in Kosovo, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. No other study has fully examined the importance of the Internet as a propaganda tool in wartime. Finally, Balkan Holocausts offers a theme by theme analysis of Serbian and Croatian propaganda, using contemporary media sources, novels, academic works and journals. Many of the writers reviewed have not been studied in any depth elsewhere thus far, and there is a definite need to criticise and compare their works. The role of Slobodan Miloevic in the construction of Serbophobia is considered fully as is Tito&apos;s involvement in the war, and the important Moslem question. This study throws comparative light on the use and abuse of propaganda in other contemporary and recent conflicts around the world. It will cast a fascinating and illuminating light on the Balkan conflict, setting the conflict in its proper psychological and intellectual context, wherein war fever and paranoia led eventually to war crimes of the lowest possible nature.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The high ideals of anarchism have inspired generations of activists and political thinkers for over a century and a half, winning respect from even the fiercest of opponents. As the &apos;conscience of politics&apos;, anarchism&apos;s opposition to all forms of power and its emphasis on responsibility and self-determination has provided a constant benchmark for other areas of political philosophy and practice. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, with popular movements challenging the logic of globalisation, Western military imperialism and the assumptions of &apos;democratic&apos; governments, anarchist theory and practice has once again made its presence felt. &apos;Changing anarchism&apos; documents the links between these movements and contemporary anarchism and demonstrates how anarchist ideas are evolving in a global age. In particular, the book examines strands within anarchism concerned with technology, the environment and identity, and suggests that these are useful sociological tools for understanding the pervasive and interconnected nature of power. The contributors also offer practical insight into how power is being resisted in a variety of social and political contexts and how anarchist ideals are impacting on many different areas of everyday life. The balance of activist perspectives on anti-capitalism, sexuality, narcotics, education and mental health, combined with theoretical material drawn from post-structuralism, ecologism, the complexity sciences and social movement theory, ensures that Changing Anarchism will appeal to the general reader as well as to students of politics, sociology and cultural studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Multinational corporations are not merely the problem in environmental concerns, but could also be part of the solution. The oil industry and climate change provide the clearest example of how the two are linked; what is less well-known is how the industry is responding to these concerns. This volume presents a detailed study of the climate strategies of ExxonMobil, Shell and Statoil. With an innovative analytical approach, the authors explain variations at three decision-making levels: within the companies themselves, in the national home-bases of the companies, and at an international level. The analysis generates policy-relevant knowledge about whether and how corporate resistance to a viable climate policy can be overcome. The analytical approach developed by the authors is also applicable to other areas of environmental degradation where multinational corporations play a central role. The book is invaluable to students, researchers and practitioners interested in national and international environmental politics and business environmental management.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Democratization is a major political phenomenon of the current age. Democratization through the looking glass argues that our perspectives on democratization reflect the intellectual origins of the inquiry. How we see and understand it are influenced by what we &apos;bring to the table&apos;. By considering democratization across a range of disciplines from anthropology and economics, to sociology, law and area studies, this volume offers a rich combination of analytical frameworks, distinctive insights and leading points of concern. On one level the book provides anyone interested in democratization with a wide-ranging distillation of the main themes, issues, and topics, concisely written by leading experts in their field. On a second level the book advances the case for a broadly-based comparative study which includes Europe and North America alongside developing regions, while maintaining the belief that a multi-disciplinary approach enhances our understanding of democratization far more than that of a narrow political science view. The book is aimed at students of politics willing to explore the boundaries of their subject and all social scientists who need an introduction to this important contemporary phenomenon.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Destination Europe interprets and interrelates the major political, economic and security developments in Europe - including transatlantic relations - from the end of the Second World War up until the present time, and looks ahead to how the continent may evolve politically in the future. The book fills a definite lacuna in the current literature on Europe, as most studies cover only specific aspects, such as the European Union. Destination Europe by contrast weaves all the different strands of European events together into a single overall and up-to-date picture and gives the reader a deeper understanding of the continent and its current and future challenges. The first chapters trace European reconstruction and political, economic and security developments - both in the East and in the West - leading up to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Later chapters examine the European Union&apos;s reform efforts, enlargement, movement to a single currency and emerging security role; the political and economic changes in central and Eastern Europe, including Russia; the break-up of Yugoslavia and the wars that ensued; and NATO&apos;s enlargement and search for a new mission. Final chapters deal with forces affecting Europe&apos;s future such as terrorism, nationalism, religion, demographic trends and globalisation. Comprehensive, detailed and accessible, this book is a perfect introductory level text for undergraduate students of European Politics and European History</dc:description>

    <dc:description>How does the trial function? What are the tools, in terms of legal principle, scientific knowledge, social norms, and political practice, which underpin this most important decision-making process? This collection of nine essays by an international group of scholars explores these crucial questions. Focusing both on English criminal, military, and parliamentary trials, and upon national and international trials for war crimes, this book illuminates the diverse forces that have shaped trials during the modern era. The contributors approach their subject from a variety of perspectives - legal history, social history, political history, sociology, and international law. With an appreciation and understanding of the relevant legal procedures, they address wider issues of psychology, gender, bureaucracy, and international relations within the adjudicative setting. Their inter-disciplinary approach imparts to this book a breadth not usually seen in studies of the courtroom. Scholars and students of modern British history, political science, and international law, as well as legal history, will find these essays stimulating and informative. Judicial tribunals in England and Europe, 1200-1700: The trial in history, vol. I, edited by Dr Maureen Mulholland and Professor Brian Pullan, is also published by Manchester University Press.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This book focuses on the ways in which the British settler colonies of Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa treated indigenous peoples in relation to political rights, commencing with the imperial policies of the 1830s and ending with the national political settlements in place by 1910. Drawing on a wide range of sources, its comparative approach provides an insight into the historical foundations of present-day controversies in these settler societies. The assertion of exclusive control over the land and the need to contain indigenous resistance meant that the governments preferred to grant citizenship rights to those indigenous peoples committed to individual property and a willingness to abandon indigenous status. However, particular historical circumstances in the new democracies resulted in very different outcomes. At one extreme Maori men and women in New Zealand had political rights similar to those of white colonists; at the other, the Australian parliament denied the vote to all Aborigines. Similarly, the new South African Government laid the foundations for apartheid, whilst Canada made enfranchisement conditional on assimilation. These differences are explored through the common themes of property rights, indigenous cultural and communal affiliations, demography and gender. This book is written in a clear readable style, accessible at all levels from first-year undergraduates to academic specialists in the fields of Imperial and Colonial History, Anthropology and Cultural Studies.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>It is increasingly recognised that EU development cooperation policy has failed to meet its stated aims. In this book Arts and Dickson ask the obvious and important question: if the policy doesn&apos;t work, why bother with it? The authors assess why EU development policy has become largely ineffective, citing among the external causal factors the liberalisation of trade, and the growing influence of US and international actors such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund upon EU policy. It also considers contributing factors within the EU such as the enlargement of its membership and the resulting shifts in priorities. It is this analysis of internal and external factors affecting the decline of EU development policy that makes this study both innovative and unique. It brings together an impressive range of contributors from different disciplines resulting in a thorough and intelligent assessment of the debate. This study will appeal to advanced level undergraduates and academics of European politics in general, EU integration, development studies, and International Relations.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Fathers, pastors and kings: Visions of episcopacy in seventeenth-century France</dc:title>

    <dc:description>This book explores how the conceptions of episcopacy shaped the identity of the bishops of France in the wake of the reforming Council of Trent (1545-63). It demonstrates how the episcopate, initially demoralized by the Wars of Religion, developed a powerful ideology of privilege, leadership and pastorate that enabled it to become a flourishing participant in the religious, political and social life of the ancien rÃ©gime. Arguing that the traditional images portrayed by Trent and prelates such as Charles Borromeo of Milan did not offer a comprehensive model of episcopal spirituality, government and pastoral care, the study examines the distinctive images of episcopacy that were developed by French reformers and theologians to respond to the specific demands of ecclesiastical leadership and reform in seventeenth-century France. It then assesses the ways in which an increasingly assertive episcopate put these ideals into practice, and explains that the bishops&apos; tempestuous relations with the religious orders, the Jansenists, the papacy and the Bourbon monarchy were profoundly shaped by their gallican, conciliarist and independent views of episcopal duties and prerogatives. This is the first publication to analyse the attitudes of Tridentine bishops towards their office by considering the French episcopate as a recognisable caste, possessing a variety of theological and political principles that allowed it to dominate the French church. It will be indispensable to those interested in the culture of early modern catholicism and the ancien rÃ©gime.</dc:description>

       <dc:language>English</dc:language>
    <dc:description>The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe has encouraged political scientists to re-examine the comparative literature on democratisation. A vast literature has now been produced comparing transitions from authoritarianism and democratisation in different parts of the world. However, there are two major omissions in the transition literature. First, the focus of research has primarily been on national level politics, and second, the relationship between federalism and democracy has largely been overlooked. This study seeks to redress this imbalance by moving the focus of research from the national level to the vitally important processes of institution building and democratisation at the local level and to the study of federalism and democratisation in Russia. Federal states are much more difficult to set up than unitary ones, and forging a new federal system at the same time as privatising the economy and trying to radically overhaul the political system has clearly made Russia&apos;s transition triply difficult. This book builds on Cameron Ross&apos; earlier work, &apos;Regional Politics in Russia&apos;, by combining theoretical perspectives with empirical work to provide a comparative analysis of the electoral systems, party systems and governmental systems in the ethnic republics and regions and to assess the impact of theses different institutional arrangements on democratisation and federalism. Overall, this study argues that Russia&apos;s weak and asymmetrical form of federalism has played a major role in thwarting the consolidation of democracy. Federalism and democratisation in Russia exist in contradiction rather than harmony. In a vicious circle authoritarianism at the centre has been nourished by authoritarianism in the regions and vice versa. &apos;Elective dictatorships&apos; and &apos;delegative democracies&apos; are now well entrenched in many republics and authoritarian regimes are firmly established in a majority of the regions. This book will be vital reading for advanced undergraduate and graduate students of Russian politics and democratisation.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Through a study of the British Empire&apos;s largest women&apos;s patriotic organisation, formed in 1900, and still in existence, this book examines the relationship between female imperialism and national identity. It throws new light on women&apos;s involvement in imperialism; on the history of &apos;conservative&apos; women&apos;s organisations; on women&apos;s interventions in debates concerning citizenship and national identity; and on the history of women in white settler societies. After placing the IODE (Imperial Order Daughters of the Empire) in the context of recent scholarly work in Canadian, gender, imperial history and post-colonial theory, the book follows the IODE&apos;s history through the twentieth century. Chapters focus upon the IODE&apos;s attempts to create a British Canada through its maternal feminist work in education, health, welfare and citizenship. In addition it reflects on the IODE&apos;s responses to threats to Anglo-Canadian hegemony posed by immigration, World Wars and Communism, and examines the complex relationship between imperial loyalty and settler nationalism. Tracing the organisation into the postcolonial era, where previous imperial ideas are outmoded, it considers the transformation from patriotism to charity, and the turn to colonisation at home in the Canadian North.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The European Union and the role of member states is currently one of the major topics of current political debate and academic discourse. The evolution of the political system in Brussels and developments within the individual member states promise new insights into the European integration process. This book provides a country-by-country analysis of how European policy is made and applied. Its central focus is the involvement of national institutions in European policy-making: governments, parliaments, sub-national governments, the courts and public administrations. Who participates at which stage of the European Union&apos;s policy cycle and how do national institutions and non-state actors interact and fit into the Union&apos;s system? The contributors show how member states have adapted their institutional structures in different ways to European integration, especially since the Maastricht Treaty. The editors&apos; introduction argues that the extent and intensity of institutional interaction between the EU and its member states have led to a &apos;system of institutional fusion&apos;. This timely book is a comprehensive study yet of European policy-making at national level and is aimed at scholars of integration studies and comparative politics.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Fragmenting Modernism: Ford Madox Ford, the novel and the great war</dc:title>

       <dc:language>English</dc:language>
    <dc:description>Fragmenting Modernism is about Ford Madox Ford, a hero of the modernist literary revolution. Ford is a fascinating and fundamental figure of the time; not only because as a friend and critic of Ezra Pound and Joseph Conrad, editor of the &apos;English Review&apos;, and author of &apos;The Good Soldier&apos;, he shaped the development of literary modernism. But as the grandson of Ford Madox Brown, and son of a German music critic, he also manifested formative links with mainland European culture and the visual arts. In Ford there is the chance to explore continuity in artistic life at the turn of the century, as well as the more commonly identified pattern of crisis in the time. The argument throughout is that modernism possesses more than one face. Setting Ford in his cultural and historical context, the opening chapter debates the concept of fragmentation in modernism; later chapters discuss the notion of the personal narrative, and war writing. Ford&apos;s literary technique is studied comparatively, and plot summaries of his major books (&apos;The Good Soldier&apos; and &apos;Parade&apos;s End&apos;) are provided, as is a brief biography. Fragmenting Modernism will be useful for anyone studying the literature of the early twentieth century, impressionism or modernism in general terms, as well as for those who seek to investigate in detail one of the great polymorphous figures of the time.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The New Atlantis has fired the imaginations of its readers since its original appearance in 1627. Often regarded as the apotheosis of Bacon&apos;s ideas through its depiction of an advanced &apos;scientific&apos; society, it is also read as a seminal work of science fiction. Standing at the threshold of early modern culture, this key text incorporates the practical and visionary, utility and utopia. This volume of eight new essays by leading scholars provides a stimulating dialogue between a range of critical perspectives. Encompassing the fields of cultural history, history of science, literature and politics, the collection explores The New Atlantis&apos; complex location within Bacon&apos;s oeuvre and its negotiations with cultural debates of the past and present. Contributors consider the book&apos;s use of rhetoric, its narrative contexts, its political and ethical implications, its relation to the natural knowledge of the period, and the function of miracles in New Atlantan society. The politics of colonialism and Jewish toleration, its complex representation of gender, and the role and politics of censorship are also explored. This volume will be the ideal companion to Bacon&apos;s The New Atlantis and for all students of literature, politics, history, cultural history and history of science.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The eighteenth century was for long described as &apos;the classical age of the constitution&apos; in Britain. The prevailing impression was one of cabinet government based on a two-party system of Whigs and Tories in Parliament, and a monarchy whose powers had been emasculated by the Glorious Revolution of 1688-89. This simple picture was destroyed in 1929 when Sir Lewis Namier published The structure of politics at the accession of George III. In this canonical work, he demonstrated that the monarchy was far more than simply a cipher and that no such party system existed, finding rather that the political divide in Parliament was of an administration comprising a court party and some political factions facing an opposition of other factions, with the votes of independent MPs divided and fluctuating between the two. In this fascinating book Peter D. G. Thomas, Namier&apos;s last research student, continues the political story into the first decade of the reign of George III. One of the most controversial figures in modern British history, the King has often been blamed for the loss of Britain&apos;s American colonies in an attempt to restore royal power. However, through an analysis of key politicians and ministries of the period, the author here uses Namier&apos;s findings to demonstrate that George III was not seeking to advance royal power, and throws light on the extent to which a system of party politics was in operation. In addition, although the structure of British politics revealed by Namier provides the setting for this study, America, India and Ireland are also considered here as important issues of the time. Providing the first chronological survey of power politics and policy-making in the first ten years of George III&apos;s reign, this book will be invaluable to all undergraduates studying eighteenth-century British history.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Germany and the use of force: The evolution of German security policy 1990-2003</dc:title>

    <dc:description>Mobilising the concept of strategic culture, this study develops a sophisticated and innovative framework to understand developments in German security policy between 1990 and 2003. Germany&apos;s contemporary security policies are characterised by a peculiar mix of continuity and change. From abstention in the first Gulf war, to early peacekeeping missions in Bosnia in the early 1990s and a full combat role in Kosovo in 1999, the pace of change in German security policy since the end of the Cold War has been breathtaking. The extent of this change has recently, however, been questioned, as seen most vividly in Berlin&apos;s response to &apos;9/11&apos; and its subsequent stalwart opposition to the US-led war on terrorism in Iraq in 2003. Beginning with a consideration of the notion of strategic culture, the study refines and adapts the concept to the case of Germany through a consideration of aspects of the rearmament of West Germany. The study then critically evaluates the transformation of the role of the Bundeswehr up to and including the war on terrorism, together with Germany&apos;s troubled efforts to enact defence reforms as well as the complex politics surrounding the policy of conscription. By focusing on both the &apos;domestics&apos; of security policy decision making as well as the changing and often contradictory expectations of Germany&apos;s allies, this book provides a comprehensive analysis of the role played by Germany&apos;s particular strategic culture in shaping policy choices. The book concludes by pointing to the vibrancy of Germany&apos;s strategic culture and argues that it will continue to define Berlin&apos;s approach to the use of force. Crucially, this may mean that Germany&apos;s perspectives may depart substantially from those of its key partners and allies. This book is essential reading for all those interested in contemporary European security as well as German politics.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This exciting book provides an illuminating account of contemporary globalization that is grounded in actual transformations in the areas of production and the workplace. It reveals the social and political contests that give &apos;global&apos; its meaning, by examining the contested nature of globalization as it is expressed in the restructuring of work. Rejecting conventional explanations of globalization as a process that automatically leads to transformations in working lives, or as a project that is strategically designed to bring about lean and flexible forms of production, this book advances an understanding of the social practices that constitute global change. Through case studies that span from the labour flexibility debates in Britain and Germany, to the strategies and tactics of corporations and workers, the author examines how globalization is interpreted and experienced in everyday life. Contestation, she argues, is about more than just direct protests and resistances. It has become a central feature of the practices that enable or confound global restructuring. This book offers students and scholars of international political economy, sociology and industrial relations an innovative framework for the analysis of globalisation and the restructuring of work.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Half the battle: Civilian morale in Britain during the Second World War</dc:title>

    <dc:description>How well did civilian morale stand up to the pressures of total war and what factors were important to it? In this important work, Robert Mackay offers a robust rejection of recent contentions that civilian morale fell a long way short of the favourable picture presented at the time and in hundreds of books and films ever since. Whilst acknowledging that some negative attitudes and behaviours existed - panic and defeatism, ration-cheating and black-marketeering, looting, absenteeism and strikes - the author argues that these involved a very small minority of the population. In fact, most people behaved well, and this should be the real measure of civilian morale, rather than the failings of the few who behaved badly. This book shows that before the War the official prognosis was pessimistic but that measures to bolster morale were taken nevertheless, in particular with regard to protection against air raids. An examination of a range of indicative factors concludes that morale fluctuated but was in the main good, right until the end of the War. In explaining this phenomenon, due credit is accorded to government policies for the maintenance of morale, but special emphasis is given to the &apos;invisible&apos; chain of patriotic feeling that held the nation together during its time of trial. This book will give students of the Second World War new insights into how and why ordinary people coped with the intolerable.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>From the prize-winning author of Flat Racing and British Society 1780-1914, this is the first book to provide a detailed consideration of the history of racing in British culture and society and to explore the cultural world of racing during the inter-war years. It breaks new ground by showing how racing&apos;s pleasures were enjoyed even by the supposedly respectable middle classes, and gave some working-class groups hope and consolation during economically difficult times. Regular attendance and increased spending on betting were found across class and generation, and women too were keen participants. Enjoyed by the Royal Family and controlled by the Jockey Club and National Hunt Committee, racing&apos;s visible emphasis on rank and status helped defend hierarchy and gentlemanly amateurism, and provided support for more conservative British attitudes. The mass media provided a cumulative cultural validation of racing, helping define national and regional identity, and encouraging the affluent consumption of sporting experience and frank enjoyment of betting. The broader cultural approach of the first half of the book is followed by an exploration of the internal culture of racing itself: the racecourse and course life, trainers and jockeys, owners and breeders. Written with flair and making full use of thorough research and original sources, Horseracing and the British 1919-39 is an important text for undergraduate courses on the history of modern British society, sport, and cultural studies, and will be welcomed by racing enthusiasts everywhere.</dc:description>

    <dc:title>Human Rights and the Borders of Suffering: The Promotion of Human Rights in International Politics</dc:title>

       <dc:language>English</dc:language>
    <dc:description>This book, newly available in paperback, argues for greater openness in the ways we approach human rights and international rights promotion, and in so doing brings some new understanding to old debates. Starting with the realities of abuse rather than the liberal architecture of rights, it casts human rights as a language for probing the political dimensions of suffering. Seen in this context, the predominant Western models of rights generate a substantial but also problematic and not always emancipatory array of practices. These models are far from answering the questions about the nature of political community that are raised by the systemic infliction of suffering. Rather than a simple message from &apos;us&apos; to &apos;them&apos;, then, rights promotion is a long and difficult conversation about the relationship between political organisations and suffering. Three case studies are explored - the Tiananmen Square massacre, East Timor&apos;s violent modern history and the circumstances of indigenous Australians. The purpose of these discussions is not to elaborate on a new theory of rights, but to work towards rights practices that are more responsive to the spectrum of injury that we inflict and endure. The book is a valuable and innovative contribution to rights debates for students of international politics, political theory, and conflict resolution, as well as for those engaged in the pursuit of human rights.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>This exciting book is the first systematic study of how international environmental agreements are transformed into political action in Russia. Using three illuminating case studies on the implementation process in the fields of fisheries management, nuclear safety and air pollution control, this book fills an important gap in existing literature. While the focus in current social science debate on international environmental regimes is accumulating knowledge on &apos;implementing activities&apos; at both national and international level, this book goes one step further and examines implementation at national and regional level. This topic is of great theoretical relevance to the study of environmental politics since some of the main sources of environmental degradation in Europe are to be found in the Russian Federation. It is also of relevance to the more general debate on contemporary Russian politics and offers valuable new material on regional politics in Russia. With its emphasis on the politics of environmental and resource management, it continues the description and discussion of political processes where most accounts of Russian politics tend to stop. This book will be invaluable for undergraduates, postgraduates and academics studying environmental politics and Russian politics at regional and national level.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>The structure and regulation of consumption and demand has recently become of great interest to sociologists and economists alike, and at the same time there is growing interest in trying to understand the patterns and drivers of technological innovation. This book brings together a range of sociologists and economists to study the role of demand and consumption in the innovative process. The book starts with a broad conceptual overview of ways that the sociological and economics literatures address issues of innovation, demand and consumption. It goes on to offer different approaches to the economics of demand and innovation through an evolutionary framework, before reviewing how consumption fits into evolutionary models of economic development. Food consumption is then looked at as an example of innovation by demand, including an examination of the dynamic nature of socially-constituted consumption routines. The book includes a number of illuminating case studies, including an analysis of how black Americans use consumption to express collective identity, and a number of demand-innovation relationships within matrices or chains of producers and users or other actors, including service industries such as security, and the environmental performance of companies. The involvement of consumers in innovation is looked at, including an analysis of how consumer needs may be incorporated in the design of high-tech products. The final chapter argues for the need to build an economic sociology of demand that goes from micro-individual through to macro-structural features.</dc:description>

    <dc:description>Interpreting the Labour Party consists of twelve essays on some of the principal thinkers and schools of thought concerned with the political and historical development of the Labour Party and the wider labour movement. It examines the major methodologies and approaches in Labour studies and critically evaluates much of the most interesting scholarship in this area of study. The essays are written by contributors who have devoted many years to the study of the Labour Party, the trade union movement and the various ideologies associated with them. The collection begins with chapters that examine Labour&apos;s ideological journey and assess the impact of the &quot;new political history&quot; on views of the party. Later contributions focus on how the problematic concept of &quot;Labourism&quot; has been applied to the party by the New Left and analyse how Labour&apos;s union link has been conceptualised. Key thinkers analysed include Henry Pelling, Ross McKibbin, Ralph Miliband, Lewis Minkin, David Marquand, Perry Anderson and Tom Nairn. Each chapter situates its subject matter in the context of a broader intellectual legacy, including the works of Sidney and Beatrice Webb, Theodore Rothstein, Stuart Hall and Samuel Beer, among others. The book will be of interest to undergraduate students of British politics and political theory, and to academics concerned with Labour politics and history, trade union history and politics, research methodology and political analysis.</dc:description>
